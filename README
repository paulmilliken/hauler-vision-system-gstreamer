This program displays an RTSP video stream from an Axis camera.  More than
one camera is allowed and user can switch between camera views.  Currently,
the program can be configured to include digital zoom, pan and tilt and 
digital lighten and darken.  A record-to-disk option is also available.

To do:
  * Use optical lightening and darkening via cgi interface instead of digitally
  * Explore mechanical PTZ
  * Set up Linux OS so system starts on powerup like an appliance rather than
	a development system

This code was developed at Scion as part of FFR's hauler-vision project to
allow hauler operators to view live video from cameras in the cutover and on
the tailhold.  It will also be used as part of a tele-operation system for an
felling/bunching excavator.

The Axis P1347 camera appears to be capable of streaming H.264 encoded video up
to resolutions of 2560x1920.  However, a resolution of 1600x1200 is the highest
that I got to work with mjpeg encoding.  The latency of H.264 encoding is too
high for our application so we'll run with mjpeg at a lower resolution.  This
means we can't digitally zoom as much as I would have liked.
